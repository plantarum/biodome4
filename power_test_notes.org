* Baseline
  - Active current draw ca. 28-55 mA
  - lowpower current draw ca. 1-1.1 mA

* Temperature probe code removed
  - active current draw ca. 30 - 55 mA - I think I'm not getting an
    accurate reading of the high current draw spikes - i.e., sometimes, it
    changes too fast to be caught by my ammeter?
  - lowpower current draw is still 1-1.1 mA

* Temperature hardward disconnected
  - no change relative to having the probe code removed

* SD card code removed
  - lowpower current draw back down to 0 mA - problem identified!

* Switching chipSelect pin to INPUT mode before sleeping
  - low power current draw stays at 0 mA!
